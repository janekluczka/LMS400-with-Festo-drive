# LMS400-with-Festo-drive

Hello,

I made this project as my Engineering Thesis on Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology.

It contains code to operate Sick LMS400-0001 scanner and Festo CMMS-AS-C4-3A-G2 drive controller.
Unfortunately due to some problems RXTX library didn't work properly with Festo controller and I wasn't able to test it.
On the other hand, Sick scanner worked fine and I was able to perform scans and export them to .txt files that can be opened using Autodesk ReCap.

Cheers,
Janek
